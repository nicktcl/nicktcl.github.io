The Internet is so big that it is the fate to meet here.

I'm *@Nick* (Chuanlin, Tang), currently a graduate student in electronics and communication, interested in electronic circuits, embedded systems development, Open source router system, SDR(software radio), audio processing, data processing and modeling.

There is a moderate "squirrel hoarding", and I like to collect a variety of practical and efficient software from the Internet.

I usually like to organize my personal blog, go to ZhiHu and technology forum, and play badminton.
